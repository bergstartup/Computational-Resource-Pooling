# Computational Resource Pooling
<br>
  A middleware that pools all compute in LAN as a virtual uni-processor. This phenomenon is achieved through remote execution. "Remote execution" goes long back to the 1980s. Many prominent systems like the Condor, DAWGS, and Butler have been made with the same idea, to provide compute resource pooling.
